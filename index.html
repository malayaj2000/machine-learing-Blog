        <p>Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.</p>
        <p>It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.</p> 
        <p>Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.</p>
        <p>Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.</p>

        <p>
            The majority of practical machine learning uses supervised learning.
        </p>

        <p>
                learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.
        </p>
            
        <p>Y = f(X)</p>
            
        <p>The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.</p>
            
        <p>It is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.</p>

        <p>
            Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.
        </p>
            
        <p>These are called unsupervised learning because unlike supervised learning above there is no correct answers and there is no teacher. Algorithms are left to their own devises to discover and present the interesting structure in the data.</p>

        <p>
            Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. 
            It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. 
            Reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. 
            In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.
